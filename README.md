# CodeMirrorModes
Custom custom modes for CodeMirror.
At the moment, there are only two modes: 
- admonition: Adding support for markdown-it-admonitions
- table: Adding support for layouting tables. The mode (and corresponding css-file) evenly space cells in a table

index.js is an overlay mode, combining both above mentioned ones.
